##### Built and Architected Event-Driven Microservices for Flight Operations and Planning Data

Led the design and development of two critical microservices that support **Flight Operations** and **Flight Planning Data Distribution** within Flyadeal‚Äôs digital ecosystem. Both systems are designed as **event-driven**, decoupled microservices to ensure **real-time data exchange**, **scalability**, and seamless integration with third-party partners such as **SITA** and other aviation industry providers.

##### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Planning Data Distributor

**Purpose**:  
Built a service to ingest, process, and distribute flight planning data‚Äîincluding **route information**, **fuel plans**, **weather overlays**, and **alternate airport scenarios**‚Äîto relevant downstream systems and third-party services.

**Architecture**:  
Implemented using a **microservice architecture** with **AWS** allowing real-time and asynchronous processing of flight plan messages from dispatch systems.

**Integration**:  
Connected with **SITA** and other global data providers to ensure compliance with aviation standards (e.g., **AFTN**, **XML messaging**, **IATA formats**).

**Key Features**:
- Auto-ingests flight plans via APIs and message queues  
- Normalizes and maps data into internal formats  
- Pushes real-time updates to **operational dashboards**, **EFB and FDM systems**, and **SITA message channels**

##### üìä Flight Operations Data Sync Microservice

**Purpose**:  
Developed a service to synchronize **operational flight data** across internal airline systems‚Äîsuch as **flight schedules**, **aircraft assignments**, **delay codes**, and **crew data**‚Äîand keep stakeholders updated in real time.

**Architecture**:  
Also designed as an event-driven service, with microservices reacting to new data (e.g., updated **ETD/ETA**, **aircraft swaps** ..etc).

**Key Features**:
- Emits normalized events to systems like **crew rostering**, **Airports**, **Intrernal systems** and **reporting dashboards**
- Applies transformation and validation rules before publishing to internal topics  

---

##### üß© Common Benefits and Design Principles

- **Loose Coupling**: Each service evolves independently, reducing downtime and integration risk  
- **Observability**: Custom logs for traceability and alerting  
- **High Availability**: Deployed across multiple **AWS zones** with retry mechanisms and **dead-letter queues**  

---

##### üöÄ Impact

- Enabled **real-time operational awareness** across systems, reducing delays and improving flight predictability  
- Streamlined integration with **SITA** and partners by automating manual data handoffs  
- Reduced internal overhead and reliance on legacy systems  
- Improved **resilience**, **scalability**, and **efficiency** across airline operations
